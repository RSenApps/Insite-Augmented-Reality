META DEVELOPER KIT END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

Meta Company ("Meta") is pleased to provide to you the enclosed prototype version of the Meta 1 
Developer Kit (the "Meta 1"). You have also been provided with the Meta 1 firmware (the "Firmware") and 
the Meta 1 software development kit (the "SDK") to enable and facilitate your creation and development 
of interactive software applications to be used in connection with the Meta 1. The Firmware comes with 
your Meta 1, and the SDK can be downloaded at https://www.getameta.com/developers

The Firmware, SDK and other software products (collectively, "Product(s)") made available through the 
Meta Developer Center (the "Dev Center") are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each Product 
that you obtain through the Dev Center is subject to your prior acceptance of this Developer Kit End User 
License Agreement ("EULA"), and you agree that the terms of this EULA will apply to each Product that 
you license through the Dev Center, unless that Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement 
between you and the Application Provider of that Product, in which case the terms of that separate end 
user license agreement will govern. Your license to any Meta Product under this EULA or separate 
end user license agreement is granted by Meta, and your license to any Third-Party Product under this 
EULA or separate end user license agreement is granted by the Application Provider of that Third-Party 
Product. Any Product that is subject to the license granted under this EULA is referred to herein as 
the "Product". The Application Provider or Meta as applicable ("Licensor") reserves all rights in and to the 
Product not expressly granted to you under this EULA.

A. Terms and Conditions; Scope of License; Limitations. You agree to use the Meta 1, Products 
or any other Meta-branded products for your own personal, non-commercial purposes. Meta 
grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right and license to use the Products 
solely in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. All rights not specifically granted 
herein are reserved by Meta and, as applicable, Meta’s licensors. This license confers no 
title or ownership in the Meta 1 or Products and should not be construed as a sale of any 
rights therein. You may not distribute or make the Product available over a network where it 
could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You agree not to: (a) sell, rent, lease, 
sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Products without the express prior written
